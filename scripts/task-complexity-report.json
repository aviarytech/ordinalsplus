      "taskTitle": "Implement Verifiable Metadata Input UI",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Verifiable Metadata Input UI implementation into subtasks covering form component development, validation logic, UI/UX design, and integration with the existing inscription flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a form component with validation, tooltips, and responsive design. It's moderately complex as it requires implementing client-side validation, handling different field types, and integrating with existing systems. The code structure is already defined, which reduces complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement BTCO DID Method Creation and Resolution",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the BTCO DID Method implementation into subtasks covering key pair generation, DID document creation, DID resolution, key management, integration with ordinals indexer, and security considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing core cryptographic functionality following W3C standards. It requires secure key management, complex data structures, integration with blockchain data, and adherence to specifications. The implementation touches multiple systems (key storage, ordinals indexer) and requires careful security considerations."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate with Aces VC API for Credential Issuance",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Aces VC API integration into subtasks covering credential data preparation, API client implementation, error handling and retry logic, credential verification, and storage/management of issued credentials.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integration with an external API for cryptographic operations, handling complex data structures (W3C VC Data Model), implementing retry logic, and secure credential storage. It depends on the DID implementation and requires careful error handling for a critical feature."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the inscription transaction implementation into subtasks covering transaction structure design, CBOR metadata encoding, UTXO selection and fee calculation, transaction signing, broadcasting, and confirmation tracking.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves modifying Bitcoin transactions to include metadata according to a specific protocol. It requires deep understanding of Bitcoin transaction structure, witness data formatting, UTXO management, and fee calculation. It also integrates with multiple services (DID, VC) and requires careful handling of blockchain interactions."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Verification UI and Logic for Inscriptions",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the verification system implementation into subtasks covering credential verification logic, verification UI components, detailed results display, and external verification API endpoints.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing cryptographic verification of credentials and creating a user interface to display results. It requires integration with DID resolution and credential verification logic, but the core cryptographic operations are likely handled by existing libraries. The UI component needs to handle multiple verification states."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the curated collection feature into subtasks covering collection data model design, collection creation UI, collection credential issuance, on-chain inscription of collections, and collection display/verification components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a new credential type for collections and building UI for creation and display. It requires integration with credential issuance, inscription processes, and verification systems. The collection management involves complex data relationships and requires careful database design."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the DID linked resources implementation into subtasks covering resource data model design, resource upload UI, resource inscription on the same satoshi, DID URL resolution for resources, and resource management interface.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves extending the DID system to support linked resources, requiring careful handling of DID URL parsing, resource inscription on specific satoshis, and content type management. It requires integration with the inscription service and DID resolution system, plus building UI components for resource management."

      "taskTitle": "Develop External API for DID Resolution and Verification",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the external API development into subtasks covering DID resolution endpoints, verification endpoints, API documentation/OpenAPI spec creation, and implementation of caching and performance optimizations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating standardized API endpoints for external developers. While it builds on existing DID and verification services, it requires careful API design, proper error handling, documentation, and performance considerations. The complexity is moderate as the core functionality is already implemented in other tasks."

It requires integration with multiple backend services, implementing filtering and sorting, handling complex user flows, and creating a responsive design. The UI complexity and number of features make this a substantial task."
